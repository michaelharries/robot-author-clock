# Open Author Clock ‚è∞ - with Robots!!!

Imaging living in a humanistic, postive future where humans, robots and AI work together to make a better world? This is an exploration into ideas around what that might look and feel like. Think 'human with machine' rather than the more dystopian 'human vs machine'. It's also an exploration into AI vs human creativity, and the downsides of generated prose.

This concept from the idea of an Author Clock. Today's Author Clock is a fascinating device that tells the time through carefully selected quotes. https://www.authorclock.com/. This project is the same idea, but has fallen through a time-warp from 2080, so has future quotes about people, robots and AI.

Practically speaking, it is forked from the open-source, web-based implementation of the Author Clock Kickstarter: https://github.com/ambercaravalho/open-author-clock

Quotes are all generated by AI and inserted into script.js.
